# Hello teacher or researcher!
This is a local interface that lets you leverage several ML models created by Cursive for the analysis of writing. Files from the Cursive Moodle TinyMCE plugin can be used here to run basic analytics, compare process to product, or look for authorship similarity manually (1 by 1). 

If you have any questions about this or wish that it was easier (your in luck, we can automate it) please don't hesitate to reach out: contact@cursivetechnology.com

Cheers!
